      question: "What types of plastic can I use?",
      answer: "The EcoFilament machine can process PET, PETG, HDPE, PP, and ABS plastics. Standard PET bottles (like water or soda bottles) work best and produce the highest quality filament."
    },
    {
      question: "How much filament can I make per bottle?",
      answer: "On average, one standard 500ml PET bottle can produce approximately 40 grams of filament. Results may vary depending on the thickness and size of the bottle."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the quality of the filament?",
      answer: "Our filament matches commercial-grade quality with Â±0.03mm diameter accuracy. It's suitable for all standard FDM/FFF 3D printers and produces high-quality prints."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need any special skills to operate it?",
      answer: "No special skills are required. The machine features an intuitive touchscreen interface, and our companion app guides you through the entire process with preset profiles for different materials."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to produce filament?",
      answer: "The machine produces filament at a rate of 0.5-1.2kg per day, depending on the selected material and quality settings. A typical 1kg spool can be produced in 12-24 hours."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it noisy or smelly?",
      answer: "The EcoFilament machine operates at under 45dB, quieter than a typical refrigerator. Our advanced filtration system eliminates odors, making it suitable for home or office use."
