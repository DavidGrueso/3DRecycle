                Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile) when you visit a website. They allow the website to recognize your device and remember information about your visit, such as your preferences, settings, and how you use the website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cookies are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, enhance user experience, provide website owners with information about how the website is being used, and enable personalized advertising.
              </p>

              <h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
              <p>
                We use the following types of cookies on our website:
              </p>

              <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
              <p>
                These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly. They enable core functionality such as security, network management, and account access. You cannot opt out of these cookies.

                These cookies collect information about how visitors use our website, such as which pages they visit most often and if they receive error messages. The information collected is aggregated and anonymous; it does not identify individual visitors.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use these cookies to:

              <h3>Functionality Cookies</h3>
              <p>
                These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make and provide enhanced, personalized features. For example, they may remember your language preferences or region, so you don't have to set these preferences each time you visit.
              </p>

              <p>

              </p>
              <p>
                These cookies are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited our website and this information is shared with other organizations, such as advertisers.
              </p>
